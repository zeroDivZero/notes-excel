# NAMED RANGE

Instead of referencing cells by IDs, can name range of them. Select range of cells. In upper left in ID textfield, enter name for range (no space).

When using functions, can use named range instead.

## Advantages

* Provides context with meaningful name.
* Can ref whole table of data, simplifying functions.
* Easy navigation: In upper left cell ID textfield, hit dropdown arrow to quickly jump to named range (can also only print this selection).

## Disadvantage

* Named range always absolute ref. Careful copying function involving named range.

## Editing

If need to edit named range after creation (like renaming or changing ref cells):
