# GROUPING

To further group rows, select 1st col cells to group, then **PivotTable &rarr; Group Selection**.

If cells are dates, can **Group Field**.

By default puts each unselected row into own group. Can select them and repeat to create more groups. Default group names `Group1`, `Group2`, etc., can be changed.

Notice addition in **Rows** section, representing grouping. Can drag out to ungroup everything.

In fact, order of fields in **Rows** section determines grouping hierarchy.
