# MODIFY CALCULATION

Excel makes best guess about type of calculation applied to field dragged into **Values** section. If want to change, go to **Field Settings** to select another **Summarize by** or **Show data as**.

E.g., add same sales field twice more and configure one to be average and other to be percent delta from previous row:

![Percent Difference](/assets/pivottable-prcnt-diff.png)

Result:
