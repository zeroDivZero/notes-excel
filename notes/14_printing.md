# PRINTING

## Titles on Every Page

When printing multiple pages, column or row titles not repeated. To set up, go to:

### Page Layout &rarr; Print Titles

![Print titles](/assets/printing-titles.png)

## Page Order

If doc too wide, may not fit all columns on one page, but by default prints down then over. Check page break:

### View &rarr; Page Break Preview

To print over then down, open same **Print Titles** dialog, at bottom see **Page Order**, change to **Over, then down**.
