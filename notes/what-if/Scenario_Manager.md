# SCENARIO MANAGER

Allows quickly switching between diff scenarios of current sheet. No need for manual editing or sheet duplicating.

E.g., if current sheet shows sales forecast based on estimated growth rates per region, select those rates and **Data &rarr; What-if Analysis &rarr; Scenario Manager**. Add scenarios with diff rates as needed.
